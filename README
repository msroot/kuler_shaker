KulerShaker
===========

A small library that lets you grab colour schemes or comments from Adobe's Kuler service. You need a developer
key from Adobe before you can properly use this library. Allows you to retrieve information from the 'get',
'search', and 'comment' feeds. Results from the 'get' and 'search' feeds are returned as an array of objects 
with the following structure:

results[KulerScheme]
           |------->title
					image
					author_id
					author_name
					tags[string]
					rating
					download_count
					created_at
					edited_at    
					swatches[KulerSwatch]
					   |-------> hex_color
								 color_mode
								 channel_1
								 channel_2
								 channel_3
								 channel_4
								 swatch_index

Comments are returned as an array of objects with the following structure:

results[KulerComment]
           |------->comment
 					author
					posted_at
					theme_id
					theme_title
